How To Contribute
=================

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ``bandcamp-dl``!
It's people like *you* who make it is such a great tool for everyone.

Here are a few guidelines to get you started (but don't be afraid to
open half-finished PRs and ask questions if something is unclear!):


Workflow
--------

- No contribution is too small!
  Please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- Try to limit each pull request to *one* change only.
- Once you've addressed review feedback, make sure to bump the pull 
  request with a short note.


Code
----

- Try to adhere to PEP8 as best you can.

  - allowed line code length for this project is up to 99 chars
  - documentation line length is up to 72 chars

- Annotate functions
- Specify return types
- Add docstrings

Again, this list is mainly to help you to get started by codifying 
tribal knowledge and expectations. If something is unclear, feel free
to ask for help!
