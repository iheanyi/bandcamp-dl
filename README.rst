Filename Template
=================

The ``--template`` option allows users to indicate a template for the
output file names and directories. Templates can be built using special
tokens with the format of ``%{artist}``. Here is a list of allowed
tokens:

-  ``artist``: The artist name.
-  ``album``: The album name.
-  ``track``: The track number.
-  ``title``: The track title.

The default template is: ``%{artist}/%{album}/%{track} - %{title}``.

Bugs
====

Bugs should be reported `here <https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/issues>`_.
Please include the full output of the command when run with ``--verbose``.
The output (including the first lines) contain important debugging information.
Issues without the full output are often not reproducible and therefore
do not get solved in short order, if ever.

For discussions, join us in `Discord <https://discord.gg/nwdT4MP>`_.

When you submit a request, please re-read it once to avoid a couple of
mistakes (you can and should use this as a checklist):

Are you using the latest version?
=================================

This should report that you're up-to-date. About 20% of the reports we
receive are already fixed, but people are using outdated versions. This
goes for feature requests as well.

Is the issue already documented?
================================

Make sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying to
open. Search at the top of the window or at
`Issues <https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/search?type=Issues>`_.
If there is an issue, feel free to write something along the lines of
"This affects me as well, with version 2015.01.01. Here is some more
information on the issue: ...". While some issues may be old, a new post
into them often spurs rapid activity.

Why are existing options not enough?
====================================

Before requesting a new feature, please have a quick peek at `the list
of supported
options <https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/blob/master/README.rst#synopsis>`_.
Many feature requests are for features that actually exist already!
Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue report and detail
how the existing similar options do *not* solve your problem.

Is there enough context in your bug report?
===========================================

People want to solve problems, and often think they do us a favor by
breaking down their larger problems (e.g. wanting to skip already
downloaded files) to a specific request (e.g. requesting us to look
whether the file exists before downloading the info page). However, what
often happens is that they break down the problem into two steps: One
simple, and one impossible (or extremely complicated one).

We are then presented with a very complicated request when the original
problem could be solved far easier, e.g. by recording the downloaded
video IDs in a separate file. To avoid this, you must include the
greater context where it is non-obvious. In particular, every feature
request that does not consist of adding support for a new site should
contain a use case scenario that explains in what situation the missing
feature would be useful.

Does the issue involve one problem, and one problem only?
=========================================================

Some of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or
should open. There is no limit of issues they can or should open. While
it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one
ticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot
mark the issue as closed. Typically, reporting a bunch of issues leads
to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth,
until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.

In particular, every site support request issue should only pertain to
services at one site (generally under a common domain, but always using
the same backend technology). Do not request support for vimeo user
videos, Whitehouse podcasts, and Google Plus pages in the same issue.
Also, make sure that you don't post bug reports alongside feature
requests. As a rule of thumb, a feature request does not include outputs
of bandcamp-dl that are not immediately related to the feature at hand.
Do not post reports of a network error alongside the request for a new
video service.

Is anyone going to need the feature?
====================================

Only post features that you (or an incapacitated friend you can
personally talk to) require. Do not post features because they seem like
a good idea. If they are really useful, they will be requested by
someone who requires them.

Is your question about bandcamp-dl?
===================================

It may sound strange, but some bug reports we receive are completely
unrelated to bandcamp-dl and relate to a different or even the
reporter's own application. Please make sure that you are actually using
bandcamp-dl. If you are using a UI for bandcamp-dl, report the bug to
the maintainer of the actual application providing the UI. On the other
hand, if your UI for bandcamp-dl fails in some way you believe is
related to bandcamp-dl, by all means, go ahead and report the bug.
