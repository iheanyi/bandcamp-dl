How To Contribute
=================

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ``bandcamp-dl``!
It's people like *you* who make it is such a great tool for everyone.

Here are a few guidelines to get you started (but don't be afraid to open half-finished PRs and ask questions if something is unclear!):


Workflow
--------

- No contribution is too small!
  Please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- Try to limit each pull request to *one* change only.
- Once you've addressed review feedback, make sure to bump the pull request with a short note.
  Maintainers don’t receive notifications when you push new commits.


Code
----

- Try to adhere to PEP8 as best you can (Yes some lines will simply be too long, its ok.)

***

Again, this list is mainly to help you to get started by codifying tribal knowledge and expectations.
If something is unclear, feel free to ask for help!
